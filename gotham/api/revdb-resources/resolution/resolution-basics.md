Object resolution is the act of combining two or more Objects. For instance, it may be useful to resolve objects from
two different Source Systems that refer to the same real-world entity, to prevent duplicate objects from being created.

When objects are resolved, their independent histories are preserved and updates to each of the sub-objects will be
preserved in case objects ever need to be un-resolved later, eg, if an error in resolution was made. Additionally,
properties written directly to the resolved object can later be partitioned to any of the constituents upon unresolve.

These concepts can be described and investigated by loading the resolution metadata, which has a few components

- A `canonicalObjectPrimaryKey` which is the primary key of the resolved object.
- A `winnerObjectPrimaryKey`, which is created internally when objects are resolved. New property writes for the
  resolved object will be associated with the `winnerObjectPrimaryKey`, so that on unresolve, they can be
  cleanly separated from the constituent objects.
- A list of `otherObjectPrimaryKeys` which are other objects that have been resolved into the bag.

In the case that objects are resolved recursively, all components of the constituent objects are flattened into
this field, except for the `objectPrimaryKey` which becomes the `canonicalObjectPrimaryKey` of the
newly-resolved object.

For example, if objects `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111` and
`ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222` are resolved, you will get resolution metadata of

```json
{
  "canonicalObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111,
  "winnerObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.333333,
  "otherObjectPrimaryKeys": [ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222]
}
```

If `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111` and `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.444444` are then
resolved, you will get resolution metadata of

```json
{
  "canonicalObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111,
  "winnerObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.555555,
  "otherObjectPrimaryKeys": [
    ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222, 
    ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.333333, 
    ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.444444]
}
```

You may then unresolve `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222` from `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111`,
which will result in two objects, `ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111` and
`ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222`, with the following resolution metadata:

```json
[{
  "canonicalObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.111111,
  "winnerObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.555555,
  "otherObjectPrimaryKeys": [
    ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.333333, 
    ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.444444]
},
{
  "canonicalObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222,
  "winnerObjectPrimaryKey": ri.gotham.111111-0.object-internal.222222,
  "otherObjectPrimaryKeys": []
}]
```
